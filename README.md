# Simulation Project
A project that simulates a packages distribution system with drones. The drones are differentiated by 3 types, each one having a different distribution.<br>
The project examines different approaches of:<br>
1. The system settings, with different locations of distributions centers
2. Decision methods that set which drone will serve which customer<br>
The system's performance was examined by statistical approaches.
